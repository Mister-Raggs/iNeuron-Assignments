    "Ans.1: A key difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__ is that __getattr__ is only invoked if the attribute wasn't found the usual ways. It's good for implementing a fallback for missing attributes, and is probably the one of two you want.\n",
    "__getattribute__ is invoked before looking at the actual attributes on the object, and so can be tricky to implement correctly. You can end up in infinite recursions very easily."

    "Ans.2: descriptors are a low-level mechanism that lets you hook into an object's attributes being accessed. Properties are a high-level application of this; that is, properties are implemented using descriptors. Or, better yet, properties are descriptors that are already provided for you in the standard library.\n",

    "If you need a simple way to return a computed value from an attribute read, or to call a function on an attribute write, use the @property decorator. The descriptor API is more flexible, but less convenient, and arguably \"overkill\" and non-idiomatic in this situation. It's useful for more advanced use cases, like implementing bound methods, or static and class methods; when you need to know, for example, if the attribute was accessed through the type object, or an instance of the type.
