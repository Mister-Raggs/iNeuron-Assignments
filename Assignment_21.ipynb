    "Ans.1:  A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. This range will be bounded between the minimum and maximum possible values, but precisely where the possible value is likely to be plotted on the probability distribution depends on a number of factors. These factors include the distribution's mean (average), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. \n",

The number of people taller and shorter than the average height people is almost equal, and a very small number of people are either extremely tall or extremely short. However, height is not a single characteristic, several genetic and environmental factors influence height. Therefore, it follows the normal distribution."
