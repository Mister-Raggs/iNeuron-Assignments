    "Ans.1: The biggest change in Python 3.8 is the introduction of assignment expressions. They are written using a new notation (:=). This operator is often called the walrus operator as it resembles the eyes and tusks of a walrus on its side. Assignment expressions allow you to assign and return a value in the same expression.\n",

    "Ans.5: A generator expression is like a list comprehension, but instead of finding all the items you're interested and packing them into list, it waits, and yields each item out of the expression, one by one.\n",
    "Because a generator expression only has to yield one item at a time, it can lead to big savings in memory usage. Generator expressions make the most sense in scenarios where you need to take one item at a time, do a lot of calculations based on that item, and then move on to the next item. If you need more than one value, you can also use a generator expression and grab a few at a time."
