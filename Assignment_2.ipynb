    "Ans.1: The difference between a class and a module in python is that a class is used to define a blueprint for a given object, whereas a module is used to reuse a given piece of code inside another program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class can have its own instance, but a module cannot be instantiated. We use the ‘class’ keyword to define a class, whereas to use modules, we use the ‘import’ keyword. We can inherit a particular class and modify it using inheritance. But while using modules, it is simply a code containing variables, functions, and classes. "

This class object allows us to access the different attributes as well as to instantiate new objects of that class.\n",

    "Ans.9: 1) The child class copies the attributes (both data and procedural) from the parent class. This concept is called inheritance.\n",
